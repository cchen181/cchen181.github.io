title:  Project 1 - Street Team Placement Strategy for the WTWY Annual Gala
---

For the first project at Metis data science bootcamp, students are given a scenario in which a non-profit organization, Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY), seeks to increase participation to their annual gala as well as increase organizational financial support. To achieve this end, WTWY hires a group of data scientists, the students, to optimize the placement of the street team in MTA subway stations which will collect email signatures in exchange for tickets to the gala.

My group, consisting of four other students, completed and presented our data-driven recommendation with the class after five days. Projects at Metis are end-to-end, meaning students are required to address project problems from scratch, i.e. find data on their own. My group’s approach rests on a desire to reach those with a high-potential to align with the WTWY mission. Because of this, we wish to target high volume MTA stations in the vicinity of technology firms, in high income areas, and in areas with a high concentration of higher education. In addition, we wish to target areas with a low concentration of K-12 schools because we don’t wish to target children in our campaign. 

To create our recommendation, we downloaded MTA turnstile data along with supplementary datasets related to tech, income, higher ed, and K-12 schools. The MTA turnstile data allows us to identify amount of foot traffic at a given station through the count of entries and exits at a given turnstile over a 4 hour time period. We link the subway dataset with supplementary datasets by taking advantage of NYC zipcodes. We first create a bar chart to visualize the top 50 MTA subway stations in terms of traffic throughput. We then narrow down these stations to our top 5 stations for street teams to canvass by taking into consideration how highly ranked these stations are within the supplementary datasets. For example, our top recommendation is the Lexington/53 St station. It is in the top 4% in foot traffic in comparison to all MTA stations. Companies such as Bloomberg and IBM are in the area. Additionally, this station is in the top 8% in wealth in all of NYC. Based on a bar chart of total traffic count over the course of a day, we suggest the street team occupy the station between the hours of 12pm-8pm.  Similar analyses are provided for the remaining recommended subway stations.

Our top 5 recommended subway stations for the WTWY street team are:
1. Lexington/53 St
2. 14 St
3. 34 St - Penn Station
4. 14 St - Union Sq
5. Chambers St

Additionally, we provide action items to enable later analysis of the strength of our recommendation. Suggested action items include the collection of subway station names to quantify the effectiveness of street team out reach and survey respondees regarding tech company employment.

Personally, I believe these last statements are a key to a complete solution for the client, WTWY. Note that an analysis of the strength of our recommendation was not mentioned by the client, WTWY. However, in a real life scenario, I view it as my professional responsibility to point out to others the options they have in achieving their data-driven objectives and ways to maximize the robustness of solutions. I enjoy using the knowledge I have to not only create insight but to empower others. Here, I view this scenario as using my knowledge to promote client empowerment.

Until next time,
Christine
