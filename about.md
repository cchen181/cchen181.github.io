I am a data scientist.

What’s my favorite part about being a data scientist?  
Creative problem solving. I enjoy figuring out how to approach a problem and identifying the strengths and limitations of a given approach.

While I enjoy the problem solving process, I know how important it is to share my work. To achieve this, I believe in the pairing of good visualizations with simple explanations. 

Before data science, I spent several years honing my analysis chops in the academic research realm. There, I solved open-ended problems by mining data and searching for the signal in the noise. How did I do that? With a lot of programming on large complex datasets. And how did I do that? With a lot of tenacity, resourcefulness, curiosity, and learning on the fly. 

I’m always excited to find out where those traits lead me next.     

When not working with data, I enjoy sports, traveling, eclectic cuisine, and the great outdoors.
